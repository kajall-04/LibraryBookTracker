## 📖 OOP Concepts Demonstrated

- **Encapsulation** — `Book` class with private fields and public getters/setters
- **Abstraction** — `LibraryService` hides data management from the UI layer
- **Collections** — `LinkedHashMap` for O(1) lookup with insertion-order display
- **Java Streams** — Search and aggregation queries
- **Java Time API** — `LocalDate` and `ChronoUnit` for date arithmetic
- **MVC Pattern** — `BookTableModel extends AbstractTableModel`
- **Custom Painting** — `RoundedPanel` and `StyledButton` with `paintComponent` overrides
- **Event Handling** — `ActionListener` and `MouseAdapter`

---

## 🔮 Potential Enhancements

- [ ] File / JSON persistence across sessions
- [ ] Student register with borrowing history
- [ ] Export overdue report to CSV
- [ ] Multiple copies of the same book
- [ ] Role-based login (Librarian / Student)
